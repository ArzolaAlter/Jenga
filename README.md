This project was made in 10 hours with the following time breakdown:

* 2.5h - UML & Design
* 1h - UI & Prefab Setup
* 2h - Picking & Tweaking Visuals, Preparing the Scene & Selecting Libraries
* 4.5h - Coding, Testing & Tweaking Custom Settings

# Design & Planning
I do have to point out beforehand that ___I was never formally trained in UML/Flowcharts___. At some point I just started doing these charts with my made up nomenclature when doing personal projects & school assignments (who never asked for a design phase), so I added a legend to clarify what I did.

(You can appreciate some of the things that had to be cut/reordered here.)

# Props & Visuals

* The models, textures & HDRI were taken from [PolyHaven](https://polyhaven.com/a/round_wooden_table_01).

* The UI is something I bought long ago, but no longer remember the exact source from.

# Important Notes
I noticed the following while doing the assessment:
* The provided API had many duplicate entries, sometimes just varying in mastery level, but decided to keep them as is.
* There was a lonely 4th grade category labelled `Algebra I` alongside the more densely populated `6th-8th Grade` ones, I didn't know if it was on purpose or not, but the project was prepared to just make one tower for each category (so it self "fixed") and decided to leave it as is.
* For simplicity the API sorted the grade categories based on the order in which they were found on the response JSON (which was still an order that made sense). This is only important because the label on the corner is generated based on the "highest grade" the simulated student has gone through.
